/**
 * This package houses custom unchecked exceptions used throughout the application. These exceptions
 * are designed to handle specific error scenarios gracefully, promoting cleaner and more robust
 * code.
 *
 * <p>Unchecked exceptions contribute to code robustness by allowing developers to handle specific
 * error conditions gracefully, eliminating the need for excessive try-catch blocks and return
 * codes. This results in cleaner, more readable code that remains focused on the core tasks of
 * application development.
 *
 * <p>Unchecked exceptions maintain the integrity of method signatures, allowing for flexible error
 * handling without imposing changes to the method's interface.
